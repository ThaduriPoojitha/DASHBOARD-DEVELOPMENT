##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK In the digital age, data is one of the most valuable assets. However, raw data by itself doesnâ€™t provide value unless it is analyzed and visualized in an understandable format. This is where dashboards play a crucial role. For Task-3 of the CODTECH Internship, we were assigned to develop an interactive dashboard using industry-standard tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Dash. The objective was to take a real-world dataset and build a fully functional dashboard that provides actionable insights in a visual and user-friendly format.

I chose to implement this project using Dash, a powerful Python framework developed by Plotly for building interactive web-based dashboards. Dash is particularly suited for Python developers because it seamlessly integrates with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Plotly, making data manipulation and visualization easier.
